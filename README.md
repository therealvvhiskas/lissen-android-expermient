### Project Update 05.06.25
Since the release of v1.5.0, a lot of feature requests have piled up — but many of them can’t just be added as-is. They require rethinking the app’s structure, screens, and overall UX.

I’ll be taking some time until early July to explore ideas, sketch out alternatives, and figure out the best direction forward. Development will pick back up after that with a clearer vision.

### Features

  * Beautiful Interface: Intuitive design that makes browsing and listening to your audiobooks easy and enjoyable.
  * Cloud Sync: Automatically syncs your audiobook progress across devices, keeping everything up to date no matter where you are.
  * Streaming Support: Stream your audiobooks directly from the cloud without needing to download them first.
  * Offline Listening: Download audiobooks to listen offline, ideal for those who want to access their collection without an internet connection.

The goal of this project is to provide a minimalistic interface and a seamless experience for listening to audiobooks and podcasts.

If there’s a feature you feel is missing or would significantly improve your experience, feel free to open an issue and share your suggestion. 
While not every feature request will be implemented, all ideas are welcome and will be thoughtfully considered.
